SafeBot was developed in the need of something rather secure than fancy features, it's techniques are unique, no other bot in the market is as safest as this one, It only doesn't injects, reads memory or writes it to the program, but uses a simulating keyboard and mouse to control over your character.
It also integrates beautifully into the Client that some people might not even notice that it is even there!
This piece of software may be used on the flash client as well, for those lovers of the Flash client.
Some of the features of the SafeBot are but not limited to:

Advanced HP and MP Healer.
Looter
Additional HUD features (such as mana bar, etc).
Hokey mapping.
and much more..
